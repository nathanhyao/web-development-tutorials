### about JS

- **high level**
- **just-in-time**: compiled during execution rather than before execution
- **ECMAScript**: JS standard to work in any browser
- can be used to build **server side applications** (full-stack viable)
- used in **mobile app dev** to create cross platform apps to run in both iOS and android

**this tutorial**: JS language syntax and core concepts

### JS setup

- need a **browser, Node.js, and code editor**
- run JS in browser or Node.js runtime
- run in **browser**
  1. inspect -> console (for short snippets)
  2. between HTML script tags
  3. external JS file (use script tag attribute `src="main.js"`)
- run in **Node.js** (install Node.js first)
  1. run in console with `node main.js` or `node main`
- for JS for web-dev, best practice: use external script tag in HTML file

**this tutorial**: no web-dev with JS, use Node.js
